# My project for the marketing agency to have codbase that follows accesibility standards

## Overview

As a web developer our main concern is find the problem and solve it.As the problem with this project is obvious- to make the codebase accesible, I am going to to use mostly HTML semantic elements,will provide text alternatives ("alt text") for images or multimedia, will make sure all links in the codebase are properly working and use headings correctly to organize the structure of your content.

## Key Factors

The following topics will be addressed in this project:
* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria.
* Application's links all function correctly.
 Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* HTML
  * Semantic elements, tags.
  * Attributes.

  * CSS
  * Consolidating the selectors and properties.
  * Organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
  * Including comments before each element or section of the page.

  ## Visuals

  At the end of the project you will see the website looking like below image:
  <img width="137" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123611264/217682864-c4d972eb-a998-41fb-8cfa-2ca43678bf8d.png">

The above image shows the web application's appearance and functionality.

**Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.

## Requirements

* The webpage meets accessibility standards.
* The elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* In the icon and image elements find accessible alt attributes.
* Make sure the heading attributes fall in sequental order

## Result
* While refactoring the code provided, website now is more accessible,which will have the website  rank higher in search engines.
* Most non-semantic elements were changes to sematic.
* Was added "alt" tag to every code which contains image tag.
* Added coments on HTML file which makes code readble and easy to understand.
* Added Badges as a screnshot as of how should our website look after all changes.
